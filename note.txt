Breakdown of Key Folders and Files:
/client: The Next.js front-end of the application, where all React components, pages, and styles are managed.

/components: Contains individual UI elements like buttons, forms, profile cards, etc.
/pages: Where the Next.js pages are located, including dynamic pages like profile.js, dashboard.js, and index.js.
/public: Static files that can be served directly, such as images or fonts.
/styles: Global CSS or SCSS styles for your application.
/server: The backend section powered by Express and Node.js.

/controllers: Contains the logic for handling requests, such as creating or updating user profiles, sending emails, etc.
/models: Defines the MongoDB data models (e.g., User, Role, Profile).
/routes: Defines the Express API routes to handle requests from the front-end, such as /api/users, /api/auth/login, etc.
/middleware: Contains custom middleware, like authentication (JWT validation) and authorization (role checking).
/config: Contains configuration files for the server (e.g., MongoDB connection settings, JWT secret).
/utils: Helper functions like email sending, notifications, and birthday reminders.
/database: MongoDB-related configurations and migrations, if you have a system for seeding data or running schema migrations.

/scripts: Scripts for tasks like database seeding, batch updates, or any other automation you might need.

Key Files:
.env: Store environment-specific settings like your MongoDB URI and JWT secrets.
server.js: The entry point for the Express server that starts the application.
package.json: Handles all project dependencies and NPM scripts.
next.config.js: Configuration for the Next.js app, such as custom webpack settings, environment variables, or other configurations.
README.md: Contains project documentation, setup instructions, and additional details.
This structure will provide a clean separation between the client and server-side code, allowing for easier maintenance and future scalability.
